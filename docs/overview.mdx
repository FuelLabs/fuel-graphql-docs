# Overview

## Introduction to the Fuel GraphQL API

The Fuel GraphQL API allows you to query the Fuel blockchain for a wide range of on-chain data. It can be used to query transactions, balances, block information, and more. You can also use it to simulate and submit transactions on the Fuel network.

## GraphQL Playground

The playground is an interactive and graphical IDE that includes a reference for queries, mutations, and types. It also provides query validation and context for the underlying GraphQL schema.

You can test out the Fuel GraphQL API playground here:

**Testnet**: https://testnet.fuel.network/v1/playground

**Mainnet**: https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/playground

## RPC Endpoints

Here is a list of public RPC endpoints you can use to interact with Fuel, whether it's retrieving on-chain data or sending transactions.

| **Provider**                                            | **Testnet**                                                | **Mainnet**                                                |

| Fuel                                                    | `https://testnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql`                  | `https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql`                  |
| [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/fuel)      | `https://fuel-public.fuel-sepolia.quiknode.pro/v1/graphql` | `https://fuel-public.fuel-mainnet.quiknode.pro/v1/graphql` |

> Note: The above endpoints are provided on a best effort basis. If you are running a commercial project, we highly recommend creating an account with one of the providers above to get enhanced support and rate limits.

## Chain Id

A chain ID is a unique identifier assigned to a blockchain network, whether a testnet or a mainnet (Fuel Ignition), to ensure correct transaction signing and prevent replay attacks across chains.

**Testnet**: [`0`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/chain-configuration/blob/master/ignition-test/chain_config.json#L41)

**Mainnet**: [`9889`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/chain-configuration/blob/master/ignition/chain_config.json#L41)
