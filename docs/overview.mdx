# Overview

## Introduction to the Fuel GraphQL API
The Fuel GraphQL API allows you to query the Fuel blockchain for a wide range of on-chain data. It can be used to query transactions, balances, block information, and more. You can also use it to simulate and submit transactions on the Fuel network.

## Playground

The playground is an interactive and graphical IDE that includes a reference for queries, mutations, and types. It also provides query validation and context for the underlying GraphQL schema. 

You can test out the Fuel GraphQL API playground here: 

Beta-2 *(latest testnet)*:
https://node-beta-2.fuel.network/playground

Beta-1 *(first testnet)*:
https://node-beta-1.fuel.network/playground

You can learn more about the differences between the `beta-1` and `beta-2` networks [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/networks/networks.html).
