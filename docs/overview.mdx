# Overview

## Introduction to the Fuel GraphQL API

The Fuel GraphQL API allows you to query the Fuel blockchain for a wide range of on-chain data. It can be used to query transactions, balances, block information, and more. You can also use it to simulate and submit transactions on the Fuel network.

## GraphQL Playground

The playground is an interactive and graphical IDE that includes a reference for queries, mutations, and types. It also provides query validation and context for the underlying GraphQL schema.

You can test out the Fuel GraphQL API playground here:

**Testnet**: https://testnet.fuel.network/v1/playground

**Mainnet**: https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/playground

## RPC Endpoint

These are the RPC endpoints you can use in your applications to interact with the Fuel blockchain, whether it's retrieving on-chain data or sending transactions:

**Testnet**: https://testnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql

**Mainnet**: https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql

> Note that this is the same endpoint used in the playground above.

## Chain Id

A chain ID is a unique identifier assigned to a blockchain network, whether a testnet or a mainnet (Fuel Ignition), to ensure correct transaction signing and prevent replay attacks across chains.

**Testnet**: [`0`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/chain-configuration/blob/master/ignition-test/chain_config.json#L41)

**Mainnet**: [`9889`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/chain-configuration/blob/master/ignition/chain_config.json#L41)
