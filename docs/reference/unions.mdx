# Union Types

## `Consensus`

The type of consensus mechanism used to validate a block.

**Types:**

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#genesis">`Genesis`</a>:
Genesis consensus

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#poaconsensus">`PoAConsensus`</a>:
PoA consensus

## `Input`

An input type for a transaction.

**Types:**

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#inputcoin">`InputCoin`</a>:
An input type for a coin.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#inputcontract">`InputContract`</a>:
An input type for a contract.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#inputmessage">`InputMessage`</a>:
An input type for a message.

## `Output`

An output type for a transaction.

**Types:**

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#coinoutput">`CoinOutput`</a>:
Indicates coins were forwarded from one address to another.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#contractoutput">`ContractOutput`</a>:
Indicates the transaction updated the state of a contract.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#messageoutput">`MessageOutput`</a>:
Indicates a message output.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#changeoutput">`ChangeOutput`</a>:
Indicates that the output's amount may vary based on transaction execution, but is otherwise identical to a Coin output. Output changes are always guaranteed to have an amount of zero since they're only set after execution terminates.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#variableoutput">`VariableOutput`</a>:
Similar to `ChangeOutput`, this output type indicates that the output's amount may vary based on transaction execution, but is otherwise identical to a Coin output. On initialization, the amount on variable outputs is zero, but during execution they could be set to a non-zero value.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#contractcreated">`ContractCreated`</a>:
Indicates a contract was deployed.

## `Resource`

Either a <a href="/docs/reference/objects/#coin">`Coin`</a> or a <a href="/docs/reference/objects/#message">`Message`</a>.

## `TransactionStatus`

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#submittedstatus">`SubmitedStatus`</a>:
The transaction has been submitted.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#successstatus">`SuccessStatus`</a>:
The transaction has succeeded.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#squeezedoutstatus">`SqueezedOutStatus`</a>:
The transaction was kicked out of the mempool.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#failurestatus">`FailureStatus`</a>:
