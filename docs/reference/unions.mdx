# Union Types

## `CoinType`

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#coin">`Coin`</a>: Coin

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#messagecoin">`MessageCoin`</a>: MessageCoin

## `Consensus`

The type of consensus mechanism used to validate a block.

**Types:**

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#genesis">`Genesis`</a>: Genesis consensus

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#poaconsensus">`PoAConsensus`</a>: PoA
consensus

## `Input`

An input type for a transaction.

**Types:**

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#inputcoin">`InputCoin`</a>: An input type for
a coin.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#inputcontract">`InputContract`</a>: An input
type for a contract.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#inputmessage">`InputMessage`</a>: An input
type for a message.

## `Output`

An output type for a transaction.

**Types:**

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#coinoutput">`CoinOutput`</a>: Indicates coins
were forwarded from one address to another.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#contractoutput">`ContractOutput`</a>:
Indicates the transaction updated the state of a contract.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#changeoutput">`ChangeOutput`</a>: Indicates
that the output's amount may vary based on transaction execution, but is
otherwise identical to a Coin output. Output changes are always guaranteed to
have an amount of zero since they're only set after execution terminates.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#variableoutput">`VariableOutput`</a>: Similar
to `ChangeOutput`, this output type indicates that the output's amount may vary
based on transaction execution, but is otherwise identical to a Coin output. On
initialization, the amount on variable outputs is zero, but during execution
they could be set to a non-zero value.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#contractcreated">`ContractCreated`</a>:
Indicates a contract was deployed.

## `TransactionStatus`

The status type of a transaction.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#submittedstatus">`SubmitedStatus`</a>: The

transaction has succeeded.

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#squeezedoutstatus">`SqueezedOutStatus`</a>:

<a href="/docs/reference/objects/#failurestatus">`FailureStatus`</a>: The
