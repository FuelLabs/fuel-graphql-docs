## `statusChange(...)`: <a href="/docs/reference/unions/#transactionstatus">`TransactionStatus!`</a>

Returns a stream of status updates for the given transaction id if the current status is `[TransactionStatus::Submitted]`. Only available for the beta-2 testnet.

This stream will wait forever so it's advised to use within a timeout. It is possible for the stream to miss an update if it is polled slower then the updates arrive. In such a case the stream will close without a status. If this occurs the stream can simply be restarted to return the latest status.

**args:**

`id`: <a href="/docs/reference/scalars/#transactionid">`TransactionId!`</a>

The id of the transaction to stream status updates for.
