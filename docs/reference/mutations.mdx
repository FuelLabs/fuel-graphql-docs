## `startSession`

Initialize a new debugger session, returning its `ID`.
A new VM instance is spawned for each session.
The session is run in a separate database transaction,
on top of the most recent node state.

## `endSession`

End a debugger session.
Returns a `Boolean!` indicating whether the session was successfully ended.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

## `reset`

Reset the VM instance to the initial state.
Returns a `Boolean!` indicating whether the VM instance was successfully reset.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

## `execute`

Execute a single `fuel-asm` instruction.
Returns a `Boolean!` indicating whether the instruction was successfully executed.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

`op`: `String!`

The `fuel-asm` instruction to execute.

## `setSingleStepping`

Set single-stepping mode for the VM instance.
Returns a `Boolean!` indicating whether the mutation successfully executed.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

`enable`: `boolean`

Whether to enable single-stepping mode.

## `setBreakpoint`

Set a breakpoint for a VM instance.
Returns a `Boolean!` indicating whether the breakpoint was successfully set.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

`breakpoint`: [`Breakpoint!`](/docs/reference/objects/#breakpoint)

The breakpoint to set.

## `startTx`

Run a single transaction in given session until it hits a breakpoint or completes.
Returns a `RunResult!`.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

`txJson`: `String!`

The transaction JSON string.

## `continueTx`

Resume execution of the VM instance after a breakpoint.
Runs until the next breakpoint or until the transaction completes.
Returns a `RunResult!`.

**args:**

`id`: `ID!`

The session ID.

## `dryRun`

Spin up a new temporary node from the current state and emulate a given transaction or set of transactions.
Returns a [`[Receipt!]!`](/docs/reference/objects/#receipt) for the emulated transaction.
You can optionally use UTXO validation.

**args:**

`txs`: [`[HexString!]!`](/docs/reference/scalars/#hexstring)

An array of transaction hex strings.

`utxoValidation`: `Boolean`

Whether or not to use UTXO validation.

`gasPrice`: [`U64!`](/docs/reference/scalars/#u64)

The gas price for the multiple transactions ran during the dry run.

## `produceBlocks`

Produce blocks that can be used for testing that requires block advancement.
Returns a [`U32!`](/docs/reference/scalars/#u32).

**args:**

`startTimestamp`: [`Tai64Timestamp!`](/docs/reference/scalars/#tai64timestamp)

The start time of the produced block.

`blocksToProduce`: [`U64!`](/docs/reference/scalars/#u64)

The number of blocks to produce.

## `submit`

Submit a transaction to the transaction pool.
Returns a [`Transaction!`](/docs/reference/objects/#transaction).

**args:**

`tx`: [`HexString!`](/docs/reference/scalars/#hexstring)

The transaction hex string.
